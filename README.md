# UFOs

## Overview
For this challenge, we were given an database of UFO sightings, including the city, state, country, description, date and shape of the UFO siting. We were asked to make a webpage to easily view the results. Included in the page was the ability to filter the sightings based on the criteria included in the results. The task was accomplished using JavaScript. 

## Results
The website can be easily used by those familiar with basic filtering on commonly designed websites. Using the left-hand side of the screen, the end user can manually enter one or many filter criteria using free-text entry, and click "Filter Table" to see the results that match the search. The results will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Should the user wish to reset the search, they can click the website page header to revisit the standard search showing all results.
